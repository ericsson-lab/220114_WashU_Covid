# Notes for code development
###### 2/5/22
Could not get DADA2 to merge R1 and R2 reads from human samples (see 
explortory directory). Processed only R1 reads with Q2 (See Q2.front.R1.sh).


###### 1/16/22
When builidng PCoA plots for human samples, found that no human samples
had passed the trimming step. Assuming adpater/primer sequence input differs
between the mouse/human data sets. 

Reached out to collaborators for new input sequences.
